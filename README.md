# 8-bit-Breadboard-Computer

I recently came across this book named "digital computer electronics by Albert Paul Malvino" which really helped me attain clarity in a lot of digital design concepts and so i decided to give its chapters on simple-as-possible computers a chance.

## Features
SAP-1 is a simple bus organised computer built entirely on breadboards using Logic ICs. it has all the features of a computer a that are an ALU, registers, program counter, clock, RAM, and instruction decoder. It is equiped with:
- 8-bit data bus
- 4-bit program counter
- 8-Bytes of RAM
- 8-bit Binary Display

## Progress
- [x] ALU
- [x] Clock
- [ ] Control logic
- [ ] Instruction set & microcode
